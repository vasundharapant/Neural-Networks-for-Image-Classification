# Neural-Networks-for-Image-Classification

Created a CNN(Convoluted Neural Network) for performing multi-class classification on Mute signs. Did this in two ways:
1) Implemented an MLP(multilayer perceptron) and used Backpropagation to train the parameters of MLP.
2) Used Canny Edge detection and the Keras library to implement the various layers of the neural network.
